This is a port of ELM-CHAN FatFs library to Cypress PSOC microcontrollers.

This port is a work in progress and in a very early stage. 
Actually i am porting it to PSoc 4 microcontrollers but i have planed to port it to other PSOC microcontrollers too.

Development environment:
	- PSoc Creator 3.3
	- Cypress development kit CY8CKIT-042
	- And SDCARD socket and a 2Gb Sandisk SD card.

Repository:
	- PSoCFatFsLibrary.
	  The library.
	- PSoC4FatFs.
	  Testing software.
	
Place both folders in same location and in PSoc Creator open "PSoc4FatFs.cywrk" file. It is in PSoC4FatFs folder.

Lincense: of course, the same as ELM-CHAN library.
